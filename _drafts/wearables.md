I feel like wearable computing has been a trending topic for like three years. I would've thought by now, watches and other wearables would've been more commonplace, but I've realized that there are certain factors that prevent these smart products from becoming the norm. I'm going to attempt to list what I think are the key problems in the wearable industry right now, while focusing on one wearable in particular: the smartwatch.

###Too many features, too little features

This is a two pronged problem, because I feel like a lot of the tech industry doesn't really know what features are really supposed to be inside of a wearable. You have Samsung trying to cram all these features like texting, phone calls, games and more into a brick of a watch, and then you have brands like Pebble and Android Wear only focusing on filtering notifications for the user. This makes me, as a consumer, confused on what the fuck I'm actually supposed to want in a wearable. This differs from buying a smartphone: I know exactly what I want and what I want my phone to do when I go out and buy one. But for wearables like watches, I'm still not exactly sure because it's still not a well defined market yet.

Part of the problem then is finding that market. I think the way most wearables are heading right now is filtering notifications, as mentioned earlier. But again, this is a problem. Take a step back: do people *really* need to have a device that allows them to view relevant information 10 seconds faster? To the average consumer, it wouldn't really matter that much. You can still view your notifications without paying $200.

###A market for business, not for consumers.

The reason why smartphones and tablets are so popular is because almost everyone can use these products in one way or another.

    - Toddlers can use them to play learning games
    - Students can use them to communicate with friends (and still play games)
    - Everyday consumers can use them to take photos
    - Business people can use them to reply to emails and do work
    - ... and the list goes on and on.

The point is, there's something for everyone, and the smartphone has enough cool features to really make anyone feel welcome. But it becomes different in a watch, because there isn't any feature ubiquitous enough to make all consumers feel welcome in the market.

Honestly, if smartwatches focus on the trend of filtering notifications, it's only going to attract the people who really need to get their notifications filtered, aka business oriented people. I mean, it's not like a toddler is going to want a smartwatch for anything practical. Honestly, if you are someone who doesn't even care about checking notifications in a slightly faster way, then what's the point of buying a smartwatch?

###The battery life is atrocious

Battery life is a huge issue as well. If I'm going to wear a watch, I want it to last at *least* a couple of days before recharging it. Currently, most smartwatches require you to charge on the daily. This is unacceptable. I'm lazy, so if I have to go through the effort of charging yet another device aside from my laptop, tablet, smartphone or etc., I probably would just choose not to go through the effort at all, especially if smartwatches don't even do that much yet.

Watches, in the past 100 years or so, have lasted far beyond just one day. Why should smart wearables be any different?

###Unfashionable

Unfortunately, this is the one that takes the cake. The same Medium article mentioned earlier mentions how tech and fashion are not the same industry. People in tech generally cannot make assumptions about what "looks fashionable", just like how people in fashion generally cannot make assumptions about what will revolutionize the tech industry. This becomes a big problem, because you have companies like Pebble trying to make breakthroughs in wearables, when the biggest factor in buying a wearable is *because it doesn't look cool.*

###Solution: Focus on fashion

I'm going to focus a bit on that last statement that I made. Looking "cool" is an extremely subjective term and I'm going to admit that saying something doesn't look cool is a shitty argument for anything, but ultimately, it's true. People generally won't wear things that they find distasteful.

However, if wearables focused more on fashion and being customizable, I think more people would buy them. For example, Sony is reportedly working a smartwatch made entirely of e-paper. You can change the design of the watches at will:

And these Japanese designers have made an e-paper bowtie that also changes the design every couple of seconds:

E-paper in particular ***should*** be more commonplace in the wearable industry. They don't reflect sunlight as badly, they consume WAY less power than a LCD (my Kindle can run a month without being repeatedly charged), and they can also come in color displays (only 64 colors, but that's already way more than what I have in my closet).

If you think about it, products like these have the potential to be pretty fucking sick. Imagine products in the future, where you only have to link your shirt with your phone or something, and completely change what you're wearing with a click of a button. Or maybe you're going to a business meeting and you realize your tie is super unprofessional. Instead of changing out, *click*, you've changed your tie design and now you're ready for your meeting.

Of course, this scenario can only happen if people start focusing more on the fashion aspect of wearables. Tech people can argue that having features that focus on fashion isn't practical and doesn't solve real world problems. It might not solve huge problems, true, but say it isn't practical is pretty much neglecting an entire industry in favor for having bland features like filtered notifications.

Ultimately, people wear clothes and accessories to make a statement. Even though I'm pretty nerdy and tech-savvy myself, I still care about what I look like. I think it would be awesome to have a watch that I could willingly change the entire design by just clicking a button. It's not enough to have switchable bands and a changing watchface, like what Apple is going to do; making EVERYTHING customizable with a click of a button would be a dream come true, because it's like putting in minimal effort for a world of customizable opportunities.

But as long as big Pebble and Android Wear prioritize features like notification filtering over fashion, I don't know if they're ever going to be as popular as we would like them to be.

**Honestly, just ending on a thought, I think the Pebble Time looks pretty cool.**
